### Updated CE List

    BeGracefulU
    
### Load settings from file

### Add clear quest X times (yet will stop if runs out of energy...)

    This one is extremlly easy to do, yet my prio is document the code
    
### Update code to respect pep8

    Starting with functions

### Update custom.py to make it work after updating main.py, also, might need to change the name from 'cardPickerWithAdb.py' to something else

    
### Update some function names to be more intuitive...

### Create Spin function, it's easy, but must like to wait till a lottery event start, so I can ensure it works correctlly.

### Improve 'atack()' function...

### Some functions might break due changing some file names, update file names accordingly
