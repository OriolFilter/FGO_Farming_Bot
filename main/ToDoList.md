## 01/12/2020

### Updated CE List

    BeGracefulU
    
### Load settings from file

### Add clear quest X times (yet will stop if runs out of energy...)

    This one is extremlly easy to do, yet my prio is document the code
    
### Update code to respect pep8

    Starting with functions

### Update custom.py to make it work after updating main.py, also, might need to change the name from 'cardPickerWithAdb.py' to something else

    
### Update some function names to be more intuitive...

### Create Spin function, it's easy, but must like to wait till a lottery event start, so I can ensure it works correctlly.

### Improve 'atack()' function...

### Some functions might break due changing some file names, update file names accordingly

## 03/12/2020

### __version__ variable

## 06/12/2020

### Detect when adb is or is not enabled and try to enable it (depending of the distribution might do one command or another...) (*)
    Might want to hide the adb output, or might want to leave it just to confirm that it's working, also, might want to actually check if adb is currentlly running so i can properlly tell if the command worked or not...

## 19/01/2021

### Fixed the code, actually looked for stunned cards at the end, and not at the start...
