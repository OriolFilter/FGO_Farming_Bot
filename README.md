## Usage:

    # From terminal

        Use 'py main.py'.

    # From desktop envoirment

        If the file is not associated to Python automatically, left click 'main.py', 'open with', and click on 'Python'.

    Remember, when running the bot, it will need the folder 'templates', and a folder called 'tmp', so the bot can store the screenshots. (create 'tmp' folder if it does not exist).

    To use this bot you must need use Nox emulator with a resolution of 1280 x 720, without resizing the screen.


## How does the bot works:

    It will be doing screenshots from your NoxApplication, then filtering the results and comparing them with some templates, then proceed to act.

    When doing screenshots it will drag the application in front of your screen.

    Even dragging it in front of your screen, in case you don't have it as 'active' window, the bot will avoid calling it, in case someone needs to use the PC while the bot still running.

    Also this bot does not work at 'Android' level, it presses your screen, means that if you plan to leave it while you are doing somthing on the PC, it will result in the bot not farming.
